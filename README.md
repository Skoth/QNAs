# QNAs

A user-defined question-and-answer Chrome Extension designed with mathematics and programming in mind. To these ends, particular emphasis has been placed on: 
* Rendering equations via [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
* Code I/O formatted with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
* SPA organization through AngularJS

This project also makes use of the [textAngular](https://github.com/fraywing/textAngular) project to enable RTE customizable questions-and-answers.
